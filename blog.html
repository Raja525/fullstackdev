            <h3>Full Stack Developement</h3>
            <p>
                A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.

In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:

Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)
<br>
<br>
Because versatility is their forte, a full stack developer is expected to have in-depth expertise on everything related to web and app development. This includes user interface creation, coding, and database building, editing images in Photoshop, adding animation, and a bunch of other vital functions.
                <br>  
                <br>
                Hypothesis-driven development is a way of formalizing this approach to review, by
                stating changes in terms of hypotheses to be tested, highlighting that the work isn’t done
                until this hypothesis is tested.
                <br>
                <br>
                The work of a full stack development team is not done once a feature is delivered. Rather,
                you should be monitoring the feature to make sure it does what you expected, as well as
                constantly learning from how your site interacts with users to identify improvements that
                can be applied to continuously improve your product.

The future of full-stack development is attractive. It looks promising because of the steady growth in demand of these professionals. There are many reasons why the demand for full-stack developers is increasing and will keep rising in the coming years. Here are some of those reasons:
                Hypothesis-driven development is a way of formalizing this approach to review, by
                stating changes in terms of hypotheses to be tested, highlighting that the work isn’t done

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>New Technologies</b>
Development tools and software keep getting new updates for better performance. Even the programming languages get newer versions regularly to ensure they function better and cause less hassle. Most of the time, the new updates help with integrating different tools for enhanced productivity.

An average developer might have to put in a lot of effort to keep up with these new developments. He/she might not know how to approach the original subjects.

On the other hand, a full stack developer has to learn the relations between different technologies beforehand. So keeping up with new updates and integrations is an easy task for him/her. Moreover, he/she would already be accustomed to learning new things about web development. That’s why they remain in huge demand. 
          <br>

          You must’ve noticed how excellent the prospects are for full-stack developers. As companies are relying more and more on technology and the web, the demand for such experts is increasing.
